    "\n",
    "In the context of ONTAP REST API, `hal+json` refers to a specific media type that supports **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)**[¹](#1)[²](#2). This is implemented using the **HAL (Hypertext Application Language)** standard[¹](#1)[²](#2).\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object or attribute is returned that identifies a specific resource, a HAL-encoded link is also returned¹². This allows you to easily discover resources and obtain more details about the resource[¹](#1)[²](#2). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, `hal+json` enables hyperlinking among resources, making it easier to navigate between related resources in the API. This is particularly useful in REST APIs, where related resources often need to be fetched with additional requests¹. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when you see `Content-Type: application/hal+json` in an ONTAP REST API request or response, it indicates that the JSON payload follows the HAL standard and includes hyperlinks to related resources¹.\n",
